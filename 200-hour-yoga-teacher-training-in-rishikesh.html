                                                            I always wanted to attend a yoga teacher training course, and it happened to be at Upasana Yoga School this year. It is true that when you manifest something truly, you receive it in the most appreciated way from the Universe. My name is Kelsey, and I
                                                            am a chef by profession. A few incidents in my life changed me and my perspective towards mental and physical health. 2 months ago, I saw a teacher's video of Upasana Yoga School, and it motivated
                                                            me to give life a fresh start and impressed by their teaching, communication and knowledge, I immediately registered myself for their 100 hr YTTC in Rishikesh. Their course is one of the best
                                                            out there. It has everything that you would like to experience in life. One thing that amazed me is their teachings are so down to earth yet very knowledgeable and comprehensive.&nbsp;
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            Their team consists of well-experienced teachers and facilitators who have years of experience in the field of Yoga. They teach in such a way that every student can understand easily and practice it in their own way. Every module they offer is carefully
                                                            designed according to the needs of each student. From spiritual ceremonies to diverse excursion programs, they serve as a lifetime experience for us. Not to forget that their food is the most
                                                            appreciated thing. Being a chef, I can genuinely connect with the importance of Saatvik food in their course. It also inspired me to develop these dishes when I go back to Spain.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            Another thing I would appreciate them for is their 24/7 support. Whenever I had any queries or doubts, they responded immediately and helped me out. The staff is extremely careful about students and their requirements. The school is situated in the magnificent
                                                            surroundings of Rishikesh; the moment you enter the place, you are taken away by the mesmerizing view. It feels as if nature really wants you to be around it. Their class size was small, around
                                                            14-15 people in a batch. Because I am usually hesitant and I get some social anxiety interacting with a large group of people so this one was perfect for me. Teachers gave us proper attention.
                                                            I am particularly shy in nature, but with this 100 hrs yoga teacher training course, I couldn't have imagined that I could also overcome some fears I gained in the past few years of my life.
                                                            And it does happen; I talked to many people, and we exchanged thoughts on life, community, and everything under the sky. I started feeling more comfortable and valued here. Imagine getting close
                                                            to a new level of the spiritual journey along with facing my fear.&nbsp;
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            Additionally, their yoga teachings are on point. They would correct you a thousand times while doing asanas, motivating you to reach higher expertise in this field. Indeed Upasana Yoga School is the best yoga school in Rishikesh. Their discipline in the
                                                            school is truly commendable. Particularly in this 100 hrs YTTC, I learned the true essence of Yoga. Be it physical, mental, or spiritual. It brought a massive change in me, and I hope it will
                                                            motivate you to experience what I had here.

              same sequence and postures, supported by experienced teachers.

              Just like you involve your body in physical exercise for its
              benefits, in the same way, meditation is an exercise for mental
              health. With the power of meditation, you can control your mind
              and block negative and unnecessary thoughts. You enter into a deep
              state of relaxation where peace is the ultimate goal.

              Yoga Nidra is also known as Psychic Sleep. The practice creates a
              state between waking and sleeping. It is a state of consciousness.
              One can go into this deep and conscious sleep with the practice of
              guided meditation. Yoga Nidra can also be termed as the victory
              over sleep. You can relax your mind and complete the sleep of 8
              hours in just a short practice of yoga nidra. When you go through
              the epic, Mahabharata, you get to know that Arjuna (one of the
              Pandavas) was associated with Yoga Nidra.

            <p>
              "Shat" means "Six" and "Karma" means "Actions". Thus, as per yogic
              science, Shatkarma is six cleansing actions that help to clean
              your body and mind. It is well described in the Hatha Yoga
              Tradition. Shatkarma is an important practice to maintain a
              balance between body and mind and also promote well-being. The
              practice eliminates toxins from the body and unblocks energy
              channels.

              but this is not true. It is the philosophy of life which can also
              be found in Bhagwat Geeta, Hatha Yoga Pradipika and Upanishads.
              The basic and main philosophy of yoga is simple, body, mind, and
              soul are one and one can not separate them.

            <p>
              Ayurveda is the oldest and the most natural system of medicine
              that originated in India years ago. It is approximately 3000 years
              ago medicinal science. Ayurveda is derived from two words, "Ayur"
              means "Life" and "Veda" means "Science", thus Ayurveda describes
              the meaning "Science of Life" or 'Knowledge of Life'. As per
              Ayurvedic Science, the body is made up of five elements, i.e.
              Akash (Ether), Vayu (Air), Agni (Fire), Apas (Water), and Prithvi
              (Earth). These 5 elements create 3 doshas namely, Kapha, Vata and
              Pitta. When these are balanced, then an individual remains healthy
              and when these are imbalances, an individual remains ill. Ayurveda
              helps in balancing all of these to give you a healthy lifestyle.

                                        You have done practice sessions but what about theory? It is also as important as practice sessions. If you are not theoretically aware of Hatha yoga and its elements, you are not able to practice it well.

                    Just like you involve your body in physical exercise for its
                    benefits, in the same way, meditation is an exercise for

                    your mind and block negative and unnecessary thoughts. You
                    enter into a deep state of relaxation where peace is the
                    ultimate goal.

                                        Yoga Nidra is also known as Psychic Sleep. The practice creates a state between waking and sleeping. It is a state of consciousness. One can go into this deep and conscious sleep with the practice of guided meditation. Yoga Nidra can also be termed as
                                        the victory over sleep. You can relax your mind and complete the sleep of 8 hours in just a short practice of yoga nidra. When you go through the epic, Mahabharata, you get to know that Arjuna (one of the Pandavas)
                                        was associated with Yoga Nidra.

                                        "Shat" means "Six" and "Karma" means "Actions". Thus, as per yogic science, Shatkarma is six cleansing actions that help to clean your body and mind. It is well described in the Hatha Yoga Tradition. Shatkarma is an important practice to maintain a balance
                                        between body and mind and also promote well-being. The practice eliminates toxins from the body and unblocks energy channels.

                                        Yoga Philosophy is a powerful subject that can change one's life. Many are confused that it only exists in Patanjali's Yoga Sutras but this is not true. It is the philosophy of life which can also be found in Bhagwat Geeta, Hatha Yoga Pradipika and Upanishads.
                                        The basic and main philosophy of yoga is simple, body, mind, and soul are one and one can not separate them.

                                        Ayurveda is the oldest and the most natural system of medicine that originated in India years ago. It is approximately 3000 years ago medicinal science. Ayurveda is derived from two words, "Ayur" means "Life" and "Veda" means "Science", thus Ayurveda
                                        describes the meaning "Science of Life" or 'Knowledge of Life'. As per Ayurvedic Science, the body is made up of five elements, i.e. Akash (Ether), Vayu (Air), Agni (Fire), Apas (Water), and Prithvi (Earth). These
                                        5 elements create 3 doshas namely, Kapha, Vata and Pitta. When these are balanced, then an individual remains healthy and when these are imbalances, an individual remains ill. Ayurveda helps in balancing all of
                                        these to give you a healthy lifestyle.

                            Mudras : A mudra may involve the whole body in a combination of asana, pranayama, bandha and visualization techniques, or it may be a simple hand position. The aim is to create fixed, repetitive postures and gestures which can snap the practitioner out
                            of instinctive habit pattern and establish a more refined consciousness.

                            Bandha: Bandha is defined as “binding” tie, hold back, restrain, or lock. The basic premise of the bandha is that by restraining or locking the muscles on a physical level, a subtle unlocking occurs on a mental or energetic level. Bandha regulates the
                            flow of energy and assists the practitioner in asana.

                                Yes, there were several other Yoga Schools in Rishikesh, and yes, they all are amazing, but Upasana Yoga School is not only a yoga school but a life experience that one deserves to live. It is the most value-sharing school for yoga and a suitable fit
                                for those who have a passion for learning. Upasana Yoga School provides in-depth training on traditional yoga aspects, including Asana, Pranayama, Meditation, and more. It also focuses on understanding the Hindu culture
                                and philosophy, which gives us a holistic approach to life. One of the best things I observed there was that they connect you with the roots of the yogic lifestyle, giving you a deeper vision of the significance of yoga
                                and its teachings. The teachers are damn good; imagine talking to them as friends and confidently expressing your inner feelings. Woww, where do you get such teachers that bring the most out of you and show you the right
                                path that creates a safe and inclusive environment for students to practice yoga with freedom? 😀
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Upasana Yoga School has a very extensive yet interesting course curriculum designed to nurture the students spiritually and physically. This includes various other techniques that help to balance the body, mind, and soul. It&rsquo;s like they energize
                                the three most elements in our human body and take our training level to another extent. They teach you challenging poses and take you through a journey that makes you vulnerable but trust me; these guys are crazy tutors
                                and, indeed, the BEST in what they do. I am thankful to Sadhu Ji, one of the most creative teachers with intense energy to cultivate your philosophical aspect. His way of easing philosophy during the session is phenomenal
                                and edutaining. Guru Ji also has a funny side to him which we all loved; his aura made us all forget about the problems and worries of life. Even Tanushree ji is a great pranayam teacher. Every day, something was amazing
                                to look at, and we did not feel like missing something for even a minute. At Yogashala, life flows, and I agree that it shapes everything around you with a beautiful perspective. Oh, I really craved some fun activities
                                during the sessions awww, they took good care of our physical outings, and we were absolutely given a lot of freedom to enjoy their excursion programs. Whatever we wanted to explore, they gave us a chance to experience.
                                Be it Ganga aarti, nature&rsquo;s trek, or going to the Beatles&rsquo; ashram, I am thankful to our teachers for making this course a celebration of yoga and life.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition, the course also includes lectures on various aspects of yoga and its importance in today&rsquo;s world. I attended the 100 hrs YTTC program at Yogashala, so I recommend you take the same. It is very well-planned and organized. No delays,
                                the food was healthy and vegan, they served a lot of great delicacies, and by 7.30 pm, you had dinner, and that&rsquo;s it. The day ends with peace and a heart full of happiness. But don&rsquo;t worry; the day ends when
                                we all chit-chat a little about the day while looking at the sky of stars surrounded by mountains. Even the stay is so comfortable. They maintain good hygiene and ensure the bed sheets are clean and rooms are good for a
                                long stay. All the facilities they commit to on the website are provided. The staff is also helpful.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Besides providing quality training, Upasana Yoga School is where you seek solace and inner peace. One thing that I would appreciate them for is that the school offers an exclusive course, a trauma and emotional healing session. I mean, who offers that?
                                The session is complimentary, and it adds more worth to the course. It also heals our inner child since we all come from different backgrounds. This is something that I am truly thankful for. 🙂

                            <p>
                                Located amidst lush green hills, it offers a serene atmosphere for practice, which helps you connect with nature and your inner self. The natural beauty of the Himalayas makes it an ideal place for yoga practice and contemplation. It&rsquo;s about transforming
                                your life from within, deepening mindfulness, and understanding the profound knowledge of yoga. You should stop manifesting a life at Yogashala and rather come here, learn, gain knowledge, and understand yoga from the perspective
                                of experts.

              the place they are studying yoga. That’s why our curriculum
              includes spiritual, educational, and relaxing trips to Yogic
              Caves, the sacred river Ganges, the Himalayan mountain, local
              sightseeing and much more!

              A Complimentary Session For All Students
            </p>
            <p>
              Emotions are the most fragile and yet the most powerful thing we
              have. As a result, it's important to understand and learn how to
              manage emotions effectively to lead a happy and fulfilling life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Individuals who have experienced trauma may struggle with
              identifying bodily sensations and interpreting frustration. As a
              result, they may react to stressful situations by either
              disconnecting from reality or displaying intense anger. This
              inability to recognize emotional triggers further impairs the
              ability to protect oneself and increases the likelihood of
              experiencing further harm.

            <p>Our Trauma &amp; Emotional Healing Program allows students to</p>

            </div>
            <p>
              The program includes an experiential one-on-one session to
              identify emotions and explore a mindfulness session to practise
              acupressure techniques, a discussion on the mind-body connection,
              and personalised coaching sessions to address issues such as
              anxiety, depression, grief, anger management, and post-traumatic
              stress disorder.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the session, you can feel your body reacting to your hidden
              and suppressed feelings that we often overlook in life. These
              feelings are a reaction of the acupressure technique (a form of
              deep tissue massage) that includes pressing certain parts of the
              body in a unique way. One can expect a stormy, chaotic and
              peaceful encounter with their inner child feelings that definitely
              brings a lot of clarity and happiness in life.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              We have taken this initiative to ensure our students receive the
              best care and support. This program will help them become
              emotionally resilient, build self-esteem, and create healthy
              relationships. Through this program, we also provide our students
              with the necessary tools to manage their emotions, take ownership
              of their thoughts and feelings, and make positive life choices for
              a successful future. We believe in the power of emotional healing
              and the importance of equipping our students with these life
              skills that will help them navigate their lives effectively.&nbsp;
              Our serene ashram environment lends itself to communing with
              nature while reflecting on your progress.

              This is going to be a unique &amp; spirit-transformative workshop
              for our students where they will experience meditation in the form
              of soothing sounds enveloped in a symphony. These sounds resonate
              deep within our emotions, make us feel relaxed, and realign our
              energies with positivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              So what happens here is that you are made to experience a
              meditative practice that involves resonant music. You literally
              bathe in the sound that comes from the vibration and sound of
              different instruments like tuning forks, chimes, crystal bowls,
              gongs, and more. You will feel as if your body is floating in some
              musical rejuvenation, and you will induce a state of deep
              relaxation.&nbsp;

                    Yes, Rishikesh is a safe place, especially for tourists. It
                    is a safer destination since it is a preferable spot for
                    yoga courses. It is tourist-friendly, and there is cultural
                    sensitivity that makes it even better for everyone who is
                    traveling from abroad. The atmosphere is spiritual and
                    tranquil &amp; the most important thing is that everyone is
                    helpful and will always greet you with a warm welcome. But
                    it is always advisable to stay informed and attentive to
                    ensure a safe and enjoyable experience.&nbsp;

                            When it comes to Yoga, any place that manages to touch you internally , be it mental or emotional , is a good place to learn and to be grateful for and Upasana Yoga School is 1 such place. The people of this place, who manage it, run it & teach here-
                            they are a family and they make you their family by the love & responsibility they share for their students. I'm someone who has done multiple TTCs and yet I was able to learn so much more especially from
                            the Asana classes that are really good, technical & detailed. The excursions that they took us on are going to stay with us forever. The extra activities like sound healing and Kirtan were amazing experiences
                            that were healing on so many different levels. We'll forever be grateful to Ashish ji, Tanu ji, Vinay ji, Rahul ji, Vikas ji, Shivam ji, Deepak, Prithvi, Arushi and the staff for their kindness and support.

                            I always wanted to do a Yoga teacher training course while I was teaching English abroad. My mum introduced me to the wonderful practice of yoga 10 years ago when I was 24 years old. No matter where I am in the world or whatever challenges I face, Yoga
                            has always been my grounding practice. 18 months postpartum, after the birth of my miracle baby boy, I was searching for yoga courses and I gratefully came across the course by Upasana Yoga School. The content
                            by Upasana Yoga School is extremely well spaced out, it is so helpful being a busy mum and I would look forward to my time every day when I would be able to practice an learn. The course is affordable and
                            the guru’s have put through so much knowledge in helping us grow. It’s been a massive transformative journey with understanding myself and every aspect of Yoga. This course is highly recommended and if you
                            have no intention of teaching yoga do this course for yourself. You will gain so much depth and a massive spiritual awakening that is life changing.

                            Just finished the 100H TTC and I am so grateful I choose this school. The teachers were amazing so knowledgeable and helpful. Throughout the course they would answer any question, go over and beyond to help me understand about asanas, yoga philosophy,
                            anatomy, pranayama, meditation and offer their support whenever I needed to. I came here having experience of 3 years doing yoga and even in the first day I was blown away by how much I actually didn't know
                            and how much more knowledge I could get out of this course. The facilities of the school were amazing, the food provided was always super tasty and made with so much care. And most importantly the psychological
                            support and positive reinforcement I got from Ashish, Tanu and all the teachers really made me feel like I was part of their yoga family. If you are looking for not just a yoga class but a life changing
                            experience you should book this school without a second thought.

                            I'm doing the 200 hours yoga teaching training course and I have been discovering that yoga is a lot more than I thought. It has been a rewarding and enchanting experience. All the teachers instruct very well and are so dedicated to what they do. I recommend
                            the online course for people who can manage their own time, for you can study whenever you want, but there is a necessity to separate a time to the readings and videos, for in the course there is a lot of

                            Namaste 🙏 I've completed my 200 hours teacher training course at Upasana Yoga School. To begin with, searching for a good yoga institute is a daunting task. I'm super glad that I chose Upasana Yoga School - it is undoubtedly one of the best yoga institutes
                            in Rishikesh. Period. I was awestruck by the sheer hardwork and sincerity by the staff and faculty to make you feel home and comfortable from day one. The teachers are really knowledgeable and are subject
                            matter experts in their respective fields. Food was delicious and apt for yoga practice. The course was nicely balanced including theory and practicals with enough emphasis on teaching methodology. During
                            our day offs, weekend excursions and fun events were organized, which really rejuvenated the mind and induced a sense of camaraderie among students. I would highly recommend Upasana Yoga School. Definitely
                            coming back again in future for 300 hour course. Thanks! 🙂

              We prefer to communicate in English since we receive
