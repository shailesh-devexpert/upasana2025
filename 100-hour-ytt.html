                                <p>
                                    In Rishikesh at Upasana Yoga School, there exists a talented chef whose culinary expertise goes hand-in-hand with the principles of Saatvik food. Meet Chef Sunil, a culinary maestro dedicated to nourishing the minds and bodies of aspiring yogis on their
                                    transformative journey.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    His deep understanding of Saatvik food sets Chef Sunil apart&mdash;a concept rooted in yogic philosophy emphasising purity, balance, and nourishment. With meticulous care, he curates a menu that complements the students' yoga practice, incorporating seasonal
                                    produce, whole grains, and spices known for their healing properties. Each dish reflects his dedication to holistic well-being, from vibrant salads with organic greens to soul-soothing lentil stews.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Beyond his culinary prowess, Chef Sunil's warm personality and genuine love for his craft create an enchanting dining experience. His infectious enthusiasm fosters a sense of community and appreciation for the connection between food, mind, and spirit.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Chef Sunil's commitment to sustainability is another facet of his remarkable character. He champions using eco-friendly practices in the kitchen, such as reducing food waste, composting, and supporting local farmers. His passion for ethical sourcing and
                                    mindful cooking resonates with the students, inspiring them to carry these values beyond their yoga journey.

                                            Chef Sunil inspires yoga teacher training, elevating the dining experience to a sublime and harmonious union of taste, health, and consciousness. His culinary creations serve as a reminder that food can be a conduit for self-care and a catalyst for personal
                                            transformation. As the students savour their Saatvik meals, they are grateful for Chef Sunil's culinary artistry's profound impact on their journey towards becoming enlightened yogis.

                    We had students who were beginners but had a strong mind. They followed through, and rested when needed during Asana class in Savasana, which is totally acceptable. However, be aware that a teacher training is very intense. You will have to practice Asanas 2 hours twice a day (morning and evening) for 6 days a week. Therefore you need to be dedicated and fit to follow this routine. Additionally you will have theroy classes, practice meditation and pranayama. All of this takes a lot of time and energy. If you are rather looking for a challenging or relaxing Yoga vacation, we recommend you to book one of our retreats instead.

                            When it comes to Yoga, any place that manages to touch you internally , be it mental or emotional , is a good place to learn and to be grateful for and Upasana Yoga School is 1 such place. The people of this place, who manage it, run it & teach here-
                            they are a family and they make you their family by the love & responsibility they share for their students. I'm someone who has done multiple TTCs and yet I was able to learn so much more especially from
                            the Asana classes that are really good, technical & detailed. The excursions that they took us on are going to stay with us forever. The extra activities like sound healing and Kirtan were amazing experiences
                            that were healing on so many different levels. We'll forever be grateful to Ashish ji, Tanu ji, Vinay ji, Rahul ji, Vikas ji, Shivam ji, Deepak, Prithvi, Arushi and the staff for their kindness and support.

                            I always wanted to do a Yoga teacher training course while I was teaching English abroad. My mum introduced me to the wonderful practice of yoga 10 years ago when I was 24 years old. No matter where I am in the world or whatever challenges I face, Yoga
                            has always been my grounding practice. 18 months postpartum, after the birth of my miracle baby boy, I was searching for yoga courses and I gratefully came across the course by Upasana Yoga School. The content
                            by Upasana Yoga School is extremely well spaced out, it is so helpful being a busy mum and I would look forward to my time every day when I would be able to practice an learn. The course is affordable and
                            the guru’s have put through so much knowledge in helping us grow. It’s been a massive transformative journey with understanding myself and every aspect of Yoga. This course is highly recommended and if you
                            have no intention of teaching yoga do this course for yourself. You will gain so much depth and a massive spiritual awakening that is life changing.

                            Just finished the 100H TTC and I am so grateful I choose this school. The teachers were amazing so knowledgeable and helpful. Throughout the course they would answer any question, go over and beyond to help me understand about asanas, yoga philosophy,
                            anatomy, pranayama, meditation and offer their support whenever I needed to. I came here having experience of 3 years doing yoga and even in the first day I was blown away by how much I actually didn't know
                            and how much more knowledge I could get out of this course. The facilities of the school were amazing, the food provided was always super tasty and made with so much care. And most importantly the psychological
                            support and positive reinforcement I got from Ashish, Tanu and all the teachers really made me feel like I was part of their yoga family. If you are looking for not just a yoga class but a life changing
                            experience you should book this school without a second thought.

                            Following the online teacher training. The course is really clear and thorough, very profound. The teachers are very experienced en explain everything very good. It's a very complete course, not only the basics are covered, but they give you so many tips
                            and advice for when you're teaching your own classes. You can ask anything at anytime, always a quick respons. Everyone is so helpful and understanding. I would recommend this course to everyone who wants

                            I'm doing the 200 hours yoga teaching training course and I have been discovering that yoga is a lot more than I thought. It has been a rewarding and enchanting experience. All the teachers instruct very well and are so dedicated to what they do. I recommend
                            the online course for people who can manage their own time, for you can study whenever you want, but there is a necessity to separate a time to the readings and videos, for in the course there is a lot of

                            Namaste 🙏 I've completed my 200 hours teacher training course at Upasana Yoga School. To begin with, searching for a good yoga institute is a daunting task. I'm super glad that I chose Upasana Yoga School - it is undoubtedly one of the best yoga institutes
                            in Rishikesh. Period. I was awestruck by the sheer hardwork and sincerity by the staff and faculty to make you feel home and comfortable from day one. The teachers are really knowledgeable and are subject
                            matter experts in their respective fields. Food was delicious and apt for yoga practice. The course was nicely balanced including theory and practicals with enough emphasis on teaching methodology. During
                            our day offs, weekend excursions and fun events were organized, which really rejuvenated the mind and induced a sense of camaraderie among students. I would highly recommend Upasana Yoga School. Definitely
                            coming back again in future for 300 hour course. Thanks! 🙂

              You can apply for a tourist visa. As your chosen school for
              YTTC, it is our responsibility to guide and help you with
              visa assistance, but we aren't fully responsible for the
              same. We are limited to verbal assistance only. But if you
              apply for an e-tourist visa, that's even better and easy.
              Apply for a minimum of 30 days of tourist visa if you are
              applying for individual courses like 200 hour YTTC or 300
              hour YTTC, but if you are applying for 500 hour YTTC, you
              should apply for a minimum of 60 days.&nbsp;

              maintain transparency and let our students feel more
