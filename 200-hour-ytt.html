                                  <li>In order to be a good teacher, it is also important to establish / deepen your self-practice. To do so we will practice morning and evening together in a group setting, supervised and instructed by lead trainers.</li>
                                  <li>
                                    In the morning we will practice Vinyasa Kriya Flow Yoga. It entails the practice of varying flow sequences uniting asanas with breath and mantras followed by relaxation, pranayama and kriyas.

                                  <li>In the beginning of the TTC we will start these classes with basic flow exercises that are gradually improved over time, preparing to eventually flow through various asanas in a meditative way, fully aware of movement and respiration.</li>

                                    You can experience their physical and energetic effects, as also observe how different categories of asanas (bends, twists, inversions... that are investigated in theory classes) harmonize in a set.

                                  <li>we will practice Classical Hatha Yoga. In an atmosphere charged with peace and devotion, we will practice recreational shanti asanas in the tradition of Swami Sivananda and his disciple Swami Satyananda Saraswati, who framed ancient yogi teachings in a modern language, that incorporates both traditional and scientific understandings. By harmonizing all levels of human life and experience through practical means of asanas, pranayama, kriyas, bandhas and mudras we start balancing sun and moon energies (ha-tha), purify nadis and chakras and ultimately practice to gain mastery of prana in order to control the mind.</li>
                                  <li>Learn to teach and to practice a broad range of yoga asanas.</li>
                                  <li>Experience how to draw on the physical, emotional, energetic and spiritual benefits of yoga</li>

                                <p>
                                  Asanas stretch and strengthens back, shoulders and leg muscles. This is especially important to relieve stiffness and back pain difficulties, which increasingly arise in modern times through long hours of sitting. In this section you will learn common standing postures, how to explain their benefits, and experience their balancing effects on the root chakra. We will further discuss how to provide effective verbal 
                                  cues to direct practitioners coming in and out of the poses, how to verbally adjust, and how to breathe properly.

                                <p>
                                  Bending asanas loosen the back by separating vertebras and improve blood circulation around the spine. This brings vitalizing and overall health improving effects on all organs and the brain. You will receive analytical training by demonstration, conversation and the use of the TTC guidebook in how to teach, practice and adjust bending postures. The learning objects herein are to explain bending postures and their benefits; verbalize and demonstrate alignments; be aware of common misalignments and risk factors; 
                                  learn how to direct practitioners coming in and out; and how to breath in these positions.

                                <p><strong>iii. Pranayama:</strong></p>
                                <p>
                                  Pranayama is considered to be the foundation of yoga. It is perhaps the most essential aspect of yoga and life.
                                   Pranayama is the best precursor for calming and centering the mind for meditation. Pranayama regulates prana flow in the 
                                   nadis of the pranamaya kosha. Through practice, observation, and discussion you will learn most common breathing techniques,
                                    how to explain benefits, and how to direct practitioners through these exercises. We will also practice pranayama on occasional 
                                    spiritual trips and breath the fresh air in the mountains or on the rocks by the sea shore. Learning objectives are to get 
                                    an overview and practice experience of multiple pranayama techniques and learn to use powerful breath workout and pranayama
                                     techniques to: detoxify your body, balance hormones, boost immunity and energy, calm the mind, awaken your full potential
                                      to discover the true nature of the self, and brings you deeper into the yoga practice. When the mind is focused on the
                                       breath, the nervous system gets calmed down, and there is less stress on the body and it experiences better digestion and 
                                       elimination. Regular practice of pranayama trains the lungs and 
                                  improves the capacity of the respiratory system immensely (especially important during these covid times).

                                <p>These are some of the most common hand mudras in pranayama practice</p>
                                <ul class="icon-list mycc-2">
                                  <li>Nasikagra mudras (nose tip position)</li>

                                <p>
                                  According to Samkhya, one the schools of Hindu philosophy, the very first element 
                                  that manifested itself in this plane was sound and that the element of sound itself
                                   originated from Lord Shiva’s Drum. Sanskrit mantras are energy-based sounds that have
                                    the power to vibrate and resonate throughout the entire body. Sound travels five times
                                     more efficiently through water than through air, and as the human body is comprised of
                                      more than 70% water, it is therefore an excellent conductor for both sound and vibration.
                                       The regular practice of mantras especially balance the agitations of manomaya kosha. Once a week we hold a 
                                  Yajna yoga in the evening time with a puja with meditation, mantras, breathing techniques and offerings.

                                  A yogic lifestyle is a journey to create unity on all levels. This means to live every day consciously,
                                   with a focused, calm mind, seeking inner perfection at all times. This teacher training places an emphasis 
                                   on studying the vast heritage of yoga philosophy. By introducing the Samkhya system of evolution and discuss
                                    traditional texts (such as the Yoga Sutras by Patanjali) we will explore the eight limbs of Ashtanga Yoga in
                                     more detail and take a glimpse beyond the first limbs towards the ultimate goal of yoga. Next to getting 
                                     inspiration from these sacred texts, it may make us recognize the importance of a firm foundation in these 
                                     first limbs, as prerequisite to progress on this path of liberation -and how you, as prospective yoga teachers, 
                                     can assist other beings along this journey. We are looking forward to inspiring conversations about the precept 
                                     of non-violence (ahimsa), the concepts of dharma and karma, and finally the value of teaching yoga while being of
                                      service to others (seva).

                                 <p>Ayurveda is the science of living. Our practice depends on us being in balance. Through an 
                                  understanding of Ayurveda, we learn about our bodily constitution, and what kinds of diets 
                                  and lifestyles are most suitable to one’s character. Our Ayurvedic Doctor will teach you about 
                                  the theoretical basics of Ayurveda, helping you to discover a diet fitting to your type of body 
                                  and individual needs and intellectually understand the positive effects of the high qualitative 
                                  sattvic yogi diet you are served throughout the TTC. If you like to relax from the training, you will be delighted to find
                                   the yoga studio surrounded by several skilled ayurvedic massage salons.</p>

                                  In this section, you will be slowly prepared to lead a yoga class yourself. In the beginning you will 
                                  start to teach sun salutations and simple sequences to each other. With your peers, you have fun 
                                  together learning and supporting each other in this yogic growth process. In the progress of your 
                                  training, you will then start to observe and correct and finally practice teaching as the lead 
                                  instructor and participate with others teaching. Awaken your practice to this 28-day yoga challenge
                                   that will inspire you to step on your mat every day. The benefits of practicing yoga everyday can 
                                   be felt almost immediately. At the end of the month, you’ll complete the challenge feeling stronger, 
                                   more connected, and more empowered in your practice. You will gain an understanding of the specific
                                    teaching skills needed to make the learning experience for your students as easy as possible. We also
                                     give lots of contact with (Props) to aid in the Skill-Based Mobility (for range of motion), 
                                     and Restorative (for calm and recovery) practices. Yoga props are extremely useful in helping to 
                                     create sthira (steadiness) and sukha (comfort) in your yoga practice. By no means limited to beginners,
                                      props help to accommodate anatomical differences, tight muscles/joints, and limited ranges of motion.
                                       If you’ve ever wondered how to efficiently use props in your home or studio practice, we provide an 
                                       introduction to the accoutrements that could bring your asana practice, the union of body, mind, soul, 
                                       and spirit.

                                    In Rishikesh at Upasana Yoga School, there exists a talented chef whose culinary expertise goes hand-in-hand with the principles of Saatvik food. Meet Chef Sunil, a culinary maestro dedicated to nourishing the minds and bodies of aspiring yogis on their
                                    transformative journey.

                                <p>
                                    His deep understanding of Saatvik food sets Chef Sunil apart&mdash;a concept rooted in yogic philosophy emphasising purity, balance, and nourishment. With meticulous care, he curates a menu that complements the students' yoga practice, incorporating seasonal
                                    produce, whole grains, and spices known for their healing properties. Each dish reflects his dedication to holistic well-being, from vibrant salads with organic greens to soul-soothing lentil stews.

                                    mindful cooking resonates with the students, inspiring them to carry these values beyond their yoga journey.

His culinary creations serve as a reminder that food can be a conduit for self-care and a catalyst for personal
                                            transformation. As the students savour their Saatvik meals, they are grateful for Chef Sunil's culinary artistry's profound impact on their journey towards becoming enlightened yogis.

                                    We focus on traditional Hatha Yoga and Vinyasa Flow. Shiva has developed his own style, incorporating mantra with the breath. We follow ancient techniques based on Patanjali's philosophy. We believe that yoga is more than just bending and stretching;
                                    it is a path of total transformation, purifying negative tendencies through self-inquiry.

We follow ancient techniques based on Patanjali's philosophy. We believe that yoga is more than just bending and stretching; it is a path of total transformation, purifying negative tendencies through self-inquiry.

                    We had students who were beginners but had a strong mind. They followed through, and rested when needed during Asana class in Savasana, which is totally acceptable. However, be aware that a teacher training is very intense. You will have to practice Asanas 2 hours twice a day (morning and evening) for 6 days a week. Therefore you need to be dedicated and fit to follow this routine. Additionally you will have theroy classes, practice meditation and pranayama. All of this takes a lot of time and energy. If you are rather looking for a challenging or relaxing Yoga vacation, we recommend you to book one of our retreats instead.

                            When it comes to Yoga, any place that manages to touch you internally , be it mental or emotional , is a good place to learn and to be grateful for and Upasana Yoga School is 1 such place. The people of this place, who manage it, run it & teach here-
                            they are a family and they make you their family by the love & responsibility they share for their students. I'm someone who has done multiple TTCs and yet I was able to learn so much more especially from
                            the Asana classes that are really good, technical & detailed. The excursions that they took us on are going to stay with us forever. The extra activities like sound healing and Kirtan were amazing experiences
                            that were healing on so many different levels. We'll forever be grateful to Ashish ji, Tanu ji, Vinay ji, Rahul ji, Vikas ji, Shivam ji, Deepak, Prithvi, Arushi and the staff for their kindness and support.

                            I always wanted to do a Yoga teacher training course while I was teaching English abroad. My mum introduced me to the wonderful practice of yoga 10 years ago when I was 24 years old. No matter where I am in the world or whatever challenges I face, Yoga
                            has always been my grounding practice. 18 months postpartum, after the birth of my miracle baby boy, I was searching for yoga courses and I gratefully came across the course by Upasana Yoga School. The content
                            by Upasana Yoga School is extremely well spaced out, it is so helpful being a busy mum and I would look forward to my time every day when I would be able to practice an learn. The course is affordable and
                            the guru’s have put through so much knowledge in helping us grow. It’s been a massive transformative journey with understanding myself and every aspect of Yoga. This course is highly recommended and if you
                            have no intention of teaching yoga do this course for yourself. You will gain so much depth and a massive spiritual awakening that is life changing.

                            Just finished the 100H TTC and I am so grateful I choose this school. The teachers were amazing so knowledgeable and helpful. Throughout the course they would answer any question, go over and beyond to help me understand about asanas, yoga philosophy,
                            anatomy, pranayama, meditation and offer their support whenever I needed to. I came here having experience of 3 years doing yoga and even in the first day I was blown away by how much I actually didn't know
                            and how much more knowledge I could get out of this course. The facilities of the school were amazing, the food provided was always super tasty and made with so much care. And most importantly the psychological
                            support and positive reinforcement I got from Ashish, Tanu and all the teachers really made me feel like I was part of their yoga family. If you are looking for not just a yoga class but a life changing
                            experience you should book this school without a second thought.

                            I'm doing the 200 hours yoga teaching training course and I have been discovering that yoga is a lot more than I thought. It has been a rewarding and enchanting experience. All the teachers instruct very well and are so dedicated to what they do. I recommend
                            the online course for people who can manage their own time, for you can study whenever you want, but there is a necessity to separate a time to the readings and videos, for in the course there is a lot of

                            Namaste 🙏 I've completed my 200 hours teacher training course at Upasana Yoga School. To begin with, searching for a good yoga institute is a daunting task. I'm super glad that I chose Upasana Yoga School - it is undoubtedly one of the best yoga institutes
                            in Rishikesh. Period. I was awestruck by the sheer hardwork and sincerity by the staff and faculty to make you feel home and comfortable from day one. The teachers are really knowledgeable and are subject
                            matter experts in their respective fields. Food was delicious and apt for yoga practice. The course was nicely balanced including theory and practicals with enough emphasis on teaching methodology. During
                            our day offs, weekend excursions and fun events were organized, which really rejuvenated the mind and induced a sense of camaraderie among students. I would highly recommend Upasana Yoga School. Definitely
                            coming back again in future for 300 hour course. Thanks! 🙂
