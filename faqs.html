                        The closest and most convenient airport for you is to fly to New-Delhi. If you are visiting India for the first time then it is better for you to take a flight to Dehradun (city nearby),
                         and from Dehradun is a 30 min drive by car, so you save a hustle.

                        Delhi airport to Rishikesh by car is a 6 hours journey. We have a transportation package for US$ 150 which will cover your airport pick-up, transfer from Delhi to Rishikesh (by car) and after completion of the course transfer back from Rishikesh to Delhi. One way transportation i.e. Delhi airport to Rishikesh can also be availed for US$ 85. In case, your flight arrives late night and you want to stay overnight in Delhi, airport pick-up cost will be US$ 25 and a reasonably good accommodation at a hotel in Delhi can be arranged for US$ 40 or 50. Our travel arrangements are executed under the supervision of professionals and we are always ready with a back-up plan, in case of emergencies. Another good option is to travel by train (airport to New Delhi train station by car, then by train to Haridwar and from Haridwar to Rishikesh by car).
                         Travel by bus is quite cheap but a bit inconvenient for first time visitors.

In case, your flight arrives late night and you want to stay overnight in Delhi, airport pick-up cost will be US$ 25 and a reasonably good accommodation at a hotel in Delhi can be arranged for US$ 40 or 50. Our travel arrangements are executed under the supervision of professionals and we are always ready with a back-up plan, in case of emergencies. Another good option is to travel by train (airport to New Delhi train station by car, then by train to Haridwar and from Haridwar to Rishikesh by car).
                         Travel by bus is quite cheap but a bit inconvenient for first time visitors.

                        Yes, it is safe to travel alone to Rishikesh, many tourists do it. It might be a bit challenging to travel by local buses or trains sometimes if 
                        you are never been to India before, as it's very different from other parts of the world.

                                  When it comes to Yoga, any place that manages to touch you internally , be it mental or emotional , is a good place to learn and to be grateful for and Upasana Yoga School is 1 such place. The people of this place, who manage it, run it & teach here-
                                  they are a family and they make you their family by the love & responsibility they share for their students. I'm someone who has done multiple TTCs and yet I was able to learn so much more especially from
                                  the Asana classes that are really good, technical & detailed. The excursions that they took us on are going to stay with us forever. The extra activities like sound healing and Kirtan were amazing experiences
                                  that were healing on so many different levels. We'll forever be grateful to Ashish ji, Tanu ji, Vinay ji, Rahul ji, Vikas ji, Shivam ji, Deepak, Prithvi, Arushi and the staff for their kindness and support.

                                  I always wanted to do a Yoga teacher training course while I was teaching English abroad. My mum introduced me to the wonderful practice of yoga 10 years ago when I was 24 years old. No matter where I am in the world or whatever challenges I face, Yoga
                                  has always been my grounding practice. 18 months postpartum, after the birth of my miracle baby boy, I was searching for yoga courses and I gratefully came across the course by Upasana Yoga School. The content
                                  by Upasana Yoga School is extremely well spaced out, it is so helpful being a busy mum and I would look forward to my time every day when I would be able to practice an learn. The course is affordable and
                                  the guru’s have put through so much knowledge in helping us grow. It’s been a massive transformative journey with understanding myself and every aspect of Yoga. This course is highly recommended and if you
                                  have no intention of teaching yoga do this course for yourself. You will gain so much depth and a massive spiritual awakening that is life changing.

                                  Just finished the 200H TTC and I am so grateful I choose this school. The teachers were amazing so knowledgeable and helpful. Throughout the course they would answer any question, go over and beyond to help me understand about asanas, yoga philosophy,
                                  anatomy, pranayama, meditation and offer their support whenever I needed to. I came here having experience of 3 years doing yoga and even in the first day I was blown away by how much I actually didn't know
                                  and how much more knowledge I could get out of this course. The facilities of the school were amazing, the food provided was always super tasty and made with so much care. And most importantly the psychological
                                  support and positive reinforcement I got from Ashish, Tanu and all the teachers really made me feel like I was part of their yoga family. If you are looking for not just a yoga class but a life changing
                                  experience you should book this school without a second thought.

                                  I'm doing the 200 hours yoga teaching training course and I have been discovering that yoga is a lot more than I thought. It has been a rewarding and enchanting experience. All the teachers instruct very well and are so dedicated to what they do. I recommend
                                  the online course for people who can manage their own time, for you can study whenever you want, but there is a necessity to separate a time to the readings and videos, for in the course there is a lot of
                                  content, which I'm in love with.

                                  Namaste 🙏 I've completed my 200 hours teacher training course at Upasana Yoga School. To begin with, searching for a good yoga institute is a daunting task. I'm super glad that I chose Upasana Yoga School - it is undoubtedly one of the best yoga institutes
                                  in Rishikesh. Period. I was awestruck by the sheer hardwork and sincerity by the staff and faculty to make you feel home and comfortable from day one. The teachers are really knowledgeable and are subject
                                  matter experts in their respective fields. Food was delicious and apt for yoga practice. The course was nicely balanced including theory and practicals with enough emphasis on teaching methodology. During
                                  our day offs, weekend excursions and fun events were organized, which really rejuvenated the mind and induced a sense of camaraderie among students. I would highly recommend Upasana Yoga School. Definitely
                                  coming back again in future for 300 hour course. Thanks! 🙂
